# 🎯 Guessing Game – Python Project

This is **Task 2** of my **Software Development Internship** at [Prodigy InfoTech](https://prodigyinfotech.dev/).

## 🕹️ About the Game

This is a Python-based number guessing game that:
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100
- Asks the user to guess the number
- Gives feedback: whether the guess is too high or too low
- Continues until the correct number is guessed
- Displays the total number of attempts

## 📁 File
